    reply: `Ah, babe, can you believe it has been a year jestha 26? jestha 26, the day you stole my heart with that mesmerizing look, that hairstyle, and that dress... sigh... I will never forget it. I love you more than words can express. Through all the ups and downs, thank you for always being by my side. Remember June 10th? Our first message day? That was the start of something incredible. And June 29th, our first date—pure magic. But it does not stop there. September 21st, November 5th, November 28th... each day holds a special place in my heart because of you, babe. You are my rock, my everything. I love you more than yesterday but not as much as tomorrow. And oh, our visits to those special places... Godawari, where we playfully argued about who would lead our little family of two. Basantapur, where those sweet children declared that you were more beautiful than me. Pashupati, where your tender gesture of pouring coconut water over me symbolized our shared bond. Our enchanting journey to Dhulikhel, where the breathtaking views mirrored the depth of our connection. And Hattiban Park—where time seemed to stand still as we danced under the stars, where we laughed, where we loved, where we created memories that will last a lifetime. Here is to many more adventures, my darling, and to forever cherishing the magic we create together. Kisses <333333`,
